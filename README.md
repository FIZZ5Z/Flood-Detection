# Flood-Detection

This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict flooding based on images and weather data. It uses Keras' pretrained MobileNet CNN model, which is fine-tuned for flood detection through image classification.

## Features

- **Rainfall and Flood Prediction by Location**: Users can input a location to receive flood and rainfall predictions based on weather data.
- **Flood Detection by Image**: Users can upload images to detect flooding using a pretrained model.

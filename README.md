# Flood-Detection

This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict flooding based on images and weather data. It uses Keras' pretrained MobileNet CNN model, which is fine-tuned for flood detection through image classification.

## Features

- **Rainfall and Flood Prediction by Location**: Users can input a location to receive flood and rainfall predictions based on weather data.
- **Flood Detection by Image**: Users can upload images to detect flooding using a pretrained model.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running locally, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- `pip` for installing Python dependencies

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FIZZ5Z/Flood-Detection.git
   
2.Run app.py and parallely run App.js using npm start
   

## Credits

This project is inspired by and modified from the following sources:

- **Sohail Ahmed Khan**: The project was built using ideas and insights from [Sohail Ahmed Khan](https://github.com/sohailahmedkhan) [Project](https://github.com/sohailahmedkhan/Flood-Detection-from-Images-using-Deep-Learning.git). His work on flood detection inspired the implementation of the model.

-**Rainfall Prediction Model**: The idea for the rainfall prediction model was inspired by [Siddhardhan's YouTube project](https://youtu.be/Pn5NTfeKJzY?si=P-nbsgqznXrYme7m). The video covers a complete walkthrough of predicting rainfall using machine learning, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. 


- **Code Inspiration**: The code was inspired and modified from [DeepLizard](https://deeplizard.com/), with some adaptations to suit the flood detection task.
